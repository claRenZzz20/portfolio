            <p class="info">The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. <br> 
                It includes the Sun, eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), <br>
                  dwarf planets (such as Pluto), moons, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids</p>

            <div class="merinfo1">
            <h1 class="mer">MERCURY</h1>
            <p class="merinfo2">Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. <br> 
                In English, it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, <br>
                and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.</p>

         <div class="veninfo1">
         <h1 class="ven">VENUS</h1>
         <p class="veninfo2">Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in <br>
             mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus is notable for having the <br> densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets,
             composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface it has a mean temperature of <br>
              737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level.</p>

      <img src="/Images/Earth.jpg" class="earth" title="Earth">
      <div class="earthinfo1">
      <h1 class="ert">EARTH</h1>
      <p class="earthinfo2">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. <br>
         This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. <br>
         Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. <br>
         The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.</p>

      <img src="/Images/mars.jpg" class="mars" title="Mars">
      <div class="marsinfo1">
      <h1 class="mrs">MARS</h1>
      <p class="marsinfo2">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in iron(III)<br> oxide dust, 
         giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[21][22] Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, <br>
         and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing. <br>It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is 
         the second smallest of the Solar System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi).</p>

        <img src="/Images/jupiter.jpg" class="jupiter" title="Jupiter">
      <div class="jupinfo1">
      <h1 class="jup">JUPITER</h1>
      <p class="jupinfo2">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun. A gas giant, it is the largest in the Solar System. <br>
         Jupiter's mass is more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly
          less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.</p>

        <img src="/Images/saturn.jpg" class="saturn" title="Saturn">
      <div class="satinfo1">
      <h1 class="sat">SATURN</h1>
      <p class="satinfo2">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. <br>
         It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has an eighth the average density of Earth,
          but is over 95 times more massive.</p>
        </div>

        <img src="/Images/Uranus.jpg" class="uranus" title="Uranus">
      <div class="urainfo1">
      <h1 class="ura">URANUS</h1>
      <p class="urainfo2">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. <br>Most of the planet is made of water, 
         ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, <br>which astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles. 
         The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all the Solar System's planets.</p>

        <img src="/Images/neptune.jpg" class="neptune" title="Neptune">
        <div class="nepinfo1">
        <h1 class="nep">NEPTUNE</h1>
        <p class="nepinfo2">Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet <br>
             in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth and slightly more massive,
              but denser and smaller, than fellow ice giant Uranus.</p>
